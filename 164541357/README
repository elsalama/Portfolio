# Open Street Map Project

## Overview

This project is part of the Computer Programming II class. It processes Open Street Map (OSM) data to provide various functionalities like listing buildings, finding paths, and more. 
The project is implemented in C++ and makes use of various data structures and algorithms to achieve its goals.

## Features

- Load and parse OSM data
- List buildings
- Find paths between nodes
- Calculate distances
- Memory management and error handling
