# Tic-tac-toe AI

## Introduction
This project involves creating an AI-powered Tic-tac-toe game that is difficult, if not impossible, for humans to beat. 
  The AI is implemented using the Minimax algorithm, with and without Alpha-Beta Pruning, to enhance the AI's efficiency and performance.

## Features
- **Minimax Algorithm:** Implements the Minimax algorithm to evaluate the best possible moves for the AI.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Enhances the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to improve performance by reducing the number of nodes evaluated.
- **Multiple Game Modes:**
  - Human vs. Human
  - Human vs. AI (Human first)
  - AI vs. Human (AI first)
  - AI vs. AI

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main script that initializes the game and manages different game modes.
- `tictactoe.py`: Contains the TicTacToe class that implements the game board and related functions.
- `test.py`: Includes test cases to validate the correctness of the Minimax and Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning implementations.
