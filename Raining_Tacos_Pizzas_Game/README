# Food Catcher Game

## Introduction
This is a simple food catcher game I created baout 4 years ago where the player controls a trash bin to catch falling food items (tacos and pizzas) and avoid missing them. The game is built using p5.js, an easy-to-use JavaScript library for creating graphical and interactive experiences.

In this game, the player has to catch falling food items using a trash bin. The tacos give 1 point each, and the pizzas give 10 points each. The player has 5 lives, and the game is over if all lives are lost. The player can move the trash bin left and right using the 'A' and 'D' keys.
