# Bayes Classifier

## Introduction
This project implements a Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis. It classifies text as either positive or negative based on word frequencies.

## Project Files
- `bayes_classifier.py`: Contains the implementation of the Bayes Classifier.

## Usage

### Training the Classifier
To train the classifier, provide it with a list of strings where each string is in the format `sentiment|text`. Sentiment is '5' for positive and '1' for negative.

```python
from bayes_classifier import Bayes_Classifier

# Initialize the classifier
classifier = Bayes_Classifier()

# Example training data
training_data = [
    '5|This movie was fantastic! I loved it.',
    '1|This movie was terrible. I hated it.',
    # Add more training data here
]

# Train the classifier
classifier.train(training_data)
